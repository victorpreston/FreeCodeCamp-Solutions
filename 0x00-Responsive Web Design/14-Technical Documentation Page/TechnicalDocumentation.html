            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                operators, control structures, and statements.

            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>
                With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
                syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                function.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
                example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
                function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
            </p>
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }
          </code>
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";
          </code>

            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>
                            null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                            JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                            NULL, or any other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                        </li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>
                            Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                            are unique and immutable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
