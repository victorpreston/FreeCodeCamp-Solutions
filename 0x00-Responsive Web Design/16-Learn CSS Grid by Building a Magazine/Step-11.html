        Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges,
        you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are
        not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only
        changing the optional coding challenges.
