        Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges,
        you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are
        not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only
        changing the optional coding challenges.

        After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink,
        and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes
        time travel possible: the flux capacitor!
