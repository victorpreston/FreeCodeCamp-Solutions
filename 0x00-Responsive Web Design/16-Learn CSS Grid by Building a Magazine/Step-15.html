    No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build up a working
    project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own understanding of coding
    fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into
    projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real
    life has plenty of repetition.
