# Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin

We can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw our reader's eye. We can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this course, we'll build a penguin. We'll use CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of our penguin, create a background, and animate our work.
