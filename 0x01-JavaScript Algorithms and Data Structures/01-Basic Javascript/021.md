# Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.
