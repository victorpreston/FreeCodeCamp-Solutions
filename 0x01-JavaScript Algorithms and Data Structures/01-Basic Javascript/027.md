# Escape Sequences in Strings

Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Escape sequences allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to use in a string.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\t	tab
\r	carriage return
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.
