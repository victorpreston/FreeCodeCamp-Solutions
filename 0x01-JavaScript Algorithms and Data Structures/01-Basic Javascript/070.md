# Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator

The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:

if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
will return Yes only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
