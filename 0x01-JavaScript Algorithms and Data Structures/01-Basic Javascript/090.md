# Using Objects for Lookups

Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of an article object:

const article = {
  "title": "How to create objects in JavaScript",
  "link": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-guide-to-creating-objects-in-javascript-b0e2450655e8/",
  "author": "Kaashan Hussain",
  "language": "JavaScript",
  "tags": "TECHNOLOGY",
  "createdAt": "NOVEMBER 28, 2018"
};

const articleAuthor = article["author"];
const articleLink = article["link"];

const value = "title";
const valueLookup = article[value];
articleAuthor is the string Kaashan Hussain, articleLink is the string [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-guide-to-creating-objects-in-javascript-b0e2450655e8/), and valueLookup is the string How to create objects in JavaScript.
