# Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript

Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.

JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never return a 1.

Note: Like Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.
