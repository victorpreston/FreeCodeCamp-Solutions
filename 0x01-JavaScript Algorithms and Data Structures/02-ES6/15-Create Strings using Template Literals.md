# Create Strings using Template Literals

A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.

Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

Consider the code below:

```
const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
```

The console will display the strings Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro! and I am 56 years old..

A lot of things happened there. Firstly, the example uses backticks (`), not quotes (' or "), to wrap the string. Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the output. This saves inserting \n within strings. The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with ${ and }. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, for example ${a + b}. This new way of creating strings gives you more flexibility to create robust strings.
