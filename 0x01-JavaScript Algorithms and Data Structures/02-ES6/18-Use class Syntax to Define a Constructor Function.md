# Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

In ES5, an object can be created by defining a constructor function and using the new keyword to instantiate the object.

In ES6, a class declaration has a constructor method that is invoked with the new keyword. If the constructor method is not explicitly defined, then it is implicitly defined with no arguments.

```
// Explicit constructor
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
  takeOff() {
    console.log("To " + this.targetPlanet + "!");
  }
}

// Implicit constructor
class Rocket {
  launch() {
    console.log("To the moon!");
  }
}

const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
// prints To Jupiter! in console
zeus.takeOff();

const atlas = new Rocket();
// prints To the moon! in console
atlas.launch();
```

It should be noted that the class keyword declares a new function, to which a constructor is added. This constructor is invoked when new is called to create a new object.

Note: UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, as in SpaceShuttle used above.

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. You will learn more about it in the Object Oriented Programming section of the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.
