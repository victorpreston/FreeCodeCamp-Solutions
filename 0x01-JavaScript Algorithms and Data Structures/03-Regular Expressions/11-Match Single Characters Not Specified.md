# Match Single Characters Not Specified

So far, you have created a set of characters that you want to match, but you could also create a set of characters that you do not want to match. These types of character sets are called negated character sets.

To create a negated character set, you place a caret character (^) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.

For example, /[^aeiou]/gi matches all characters that are not a vowel. Note that characters like ., !, [, @, / and white space are matched - the negated vowel character set only excludes the vowel characters.
