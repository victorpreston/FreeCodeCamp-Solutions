# Match Beginning String Patterns

Prior challenges showed that regular expressions can be used to look for a number of matches. They are also used to search for patterns in specific positions in strings.

In an earlier challenge, you used the caret character (^) inside a character set to create a negated character set in the form [^thingsthatwillnotbematched]. Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

```
let firstString = "Ricky is first and can be found.";
let firstRegex = /^Ricky/;
firstRegex.test(firstString);
let notFirst = "You can't find Ricky now.";
firstRegex.test(notFirst);
```

The first test call would return true, while the second would return false.
