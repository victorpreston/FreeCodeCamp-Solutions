# Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches

Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk \* to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string ah, your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.

```
let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4);
multipleA.test(A2);
```

The first test call would return true, while the second would return false.
