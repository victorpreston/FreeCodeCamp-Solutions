# Specify Only the Lower Number of Matches

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want to specify the lower number of patterns with no upper limit.

To only specify the lower number of patterns, keep the first number followed by a comma.

For example, to match only the string hah with the letter a appearing at least 3 times, your regex would be /ha{3,}h/.

```
let A4 = "haaaah";
let A2 = "haah";
let A100 = "h" + "a".repeat(100) + "h";
let multipleA = /ha{3,}h/;
multipleA.test(A4);
multipleA.test(A2);
multipleA.test(A100);
```

In order, the three test calls would return true, false, and true.
