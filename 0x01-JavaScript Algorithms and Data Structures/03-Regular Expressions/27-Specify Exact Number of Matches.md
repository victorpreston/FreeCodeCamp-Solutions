# Specify Exact Number of Matches

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want a specific number of matches.

To specify a certain number of patterns, just have that one number between the curly brackets.

For example, to match only the word hah with the letter a 3 times, your regex would be /ha{3}h/.

```
let A4 = "haaaah";
let A3 = "haaah";
let A100 = "h" + "a".repeat(100) + "h";
let multipleHA = /ha{3}h/;
multipleHA.test(A4);
multipleHA.test(A3);
multipleHA.test(A100);
```

In order, the three test calls would return false, true, and false.
