// To do that, you can right-click the freeCodeCamp navigation bar at the top and click inspect on most browsers. 
// Then find the console tab in the window that opens.
// After that, use console.log to log the output variable. 
// View the two consoles to see the log. 
// Finally, use console.clear after your log to clear the browser console. View the difference in the two consoles.
