# Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

You may have noticed that some freeCodeCamp challenges include their own console. This console behaves a little differently than the browser console.

There are many methods to use with console to output messages. log, warn, and clear to name a few. The freeCodeCamp console will only output log messages, while the browser console will output all messages. When you make changes to your code, it will automatically run and show the logs. The freeCodeCamp console is then cleared each time your code runs.
