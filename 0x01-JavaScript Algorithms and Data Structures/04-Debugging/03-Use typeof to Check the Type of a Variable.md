# Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using typeof:

```
console.log(typeof "");
console.log(typeof 0);
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof {});
```

In order, the console will display the strings string, number, object, and object.

JavaScript recognizes seven primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new with ES6), and BigInt (new with ES2020), and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.
