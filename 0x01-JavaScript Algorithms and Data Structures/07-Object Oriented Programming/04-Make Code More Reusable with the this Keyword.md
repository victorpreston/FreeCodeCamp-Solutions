# Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword

The last challenge introduced a method to the duck object. It used duck.name dot notation to access the value for the name property within the return statement:

```
sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
```

While this is a valid way to access the object's property, there is a pitfall here. If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.

A way to avoid these issues is with the this keyword:

```
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + this.name + ".";}
};
```

this is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it. In the current context, this refers to the object that the method is associated with: duck. If the object's name is changed to mallard, it is not necessary to find all the references to duck in the code. It makes the code reusable and easier to read.
