# Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns a truthy value - that is, a value which returns true if passed to the Boolean() constructor. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

```
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30);
```

The console would display the value [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ].
