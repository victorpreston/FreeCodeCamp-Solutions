# Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method

Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. Here's an example:

```
[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
```

The returned array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
