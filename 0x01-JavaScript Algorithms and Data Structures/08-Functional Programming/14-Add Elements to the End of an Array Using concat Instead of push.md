# Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push

Functional programming is all about creating and using non-mutating functions.

The last challenge introduced the concat method as a way to merge arrays into a new array without mutating the original arrays. Compare concat to the push method. push adds items to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array. Here's an example:

```
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4, 5, 6);
```

arr would have a modified value of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is not the functional programming way.

concat offers a way to merge new items to the end of an array without any mutating side effects.
