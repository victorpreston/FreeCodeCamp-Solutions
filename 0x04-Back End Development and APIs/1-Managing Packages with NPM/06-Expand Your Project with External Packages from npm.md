# Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm

One of the biggest reasons to use a package manager, is their powerful dependency management. Instead of manually having to make sure that you get all dependencies whenever you set up a project on a new computer, npm automatically installs everything for you. But how can npm know exactly what your project needs? Meet the dependencies section of your package.json file.

In this section, packages your project requires are stored using the following format:

```
"dependencies": {
  "package-name": "version",
  "express": "4.14.0"
}
```

Add version 1.1.0 of the @freecodecamp/example package to the dependencies field of your package.json file.

Note: @freecodecamp/example is a faux package used as a learning tool.
