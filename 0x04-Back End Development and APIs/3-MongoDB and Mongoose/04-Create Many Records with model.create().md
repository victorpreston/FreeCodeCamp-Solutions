# Create Many Records with model.create()

Sometimes you need to create many instances of your models, e.g. when seeding a database with initial data. Model.create() takes an array of objects like [{name: 'John', ...}, {...}, ...] as the first argument, and saves them all in the db.

---

Modify the createManyPeople function to create many people using Model.create() with the argument arrayOfPeople.

Note: You can reuse the model you instantiated in the previous exercise.
