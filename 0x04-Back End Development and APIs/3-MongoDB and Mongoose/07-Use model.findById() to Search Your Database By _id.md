# Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By \_id

When saving a document, MongoDB automatically adds the field \_id, and set it to a unique alphanumeric key. Searching by \_id is an extremely frequent operation, so Mongoose provides a dedicated method for it.

---

Modify the findPersonById to find the only person having a given \_id, using Model.findById() -> Person. Use the function argument personId as the search key.
