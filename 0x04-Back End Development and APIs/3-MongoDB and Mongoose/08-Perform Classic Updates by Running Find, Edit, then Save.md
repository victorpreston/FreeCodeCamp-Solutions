# Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save

In the good old days, this was what you needed to do if you wanted to edit a document, and be able to use it somehow (e.g. sending it back in a server response). Mongoose has a dedicated updating method: Model.update(). It is bound to the low-level mongo driver. It can bulk-edit many documents matching certain criteria, but it doesnâ€™t send back the updated document, only a 'status' message. Furthermore, it makes model validations difficult, because it just directly calls the mongo driver.

Modify the findEditThenSave function to find a person by \_id (use any of the above methods) with the parameter personId as search key. Add "hamburger" to the list of the person's favoriteFoods (you can use Array.push()). Then - inside the find callback - save() the updated Person.

Note: This may be tricky, if in your Schema, you declared favoriteFoods as an Array, without specifying the type (i.e. [String]). In that case, favoriteFoods defaults to Mixed type, and you have to manually mark it as edited using document.markModified('edited-field'). See our Mongoose article.
